# Azure Knative channel provisioner

Cluster channel provisioner provides Knative channels with [Azure Event Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/) as messaging backend.

Ð¡reating AzureChannel object entails the following actions:

1. Controller connects to Azure account with credentials obtained from secret 
2. Controller creates all needed resources (`EventHub resource group`, `EventHub namespace`, `EventHub` and `SharedAccessPolicy` to connect to created Hub.) Note: all the titles are named after AzureChannel EventHubName spec property 
3. When connection is established and all resources are created, dispatcher starts listening to Azure Event Hub and receive events. Once event is received it is dispatched among subscribers (if any)
4. Post message to AzureChannel to send event to related Azure Event Hub.
5. When AzureChannel is removed, controller removes all the resources created in step 2 

## Deploy

We are using [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) tool to deploy custom resources:
```
ko apply -f config/
```
This will take all the configurations and deploy Azure CRD on your cluster to `knative-eventing` namespace. Change configurations if needed.

To see it's running use:
```
kubectl -n knative-eventing get pods -l messaging.triggermesh.dev/channel=azure-channel
```

## Usage

In order for a channel to connect to your Azure account, you should create k8s secret with `subscription_id`, `tenant_id`, `client_id` and `client_secret` keys. 

To obtain credentials use [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) command: 

```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > my.auth
```

Then create a secret in your namespace with Azure access data from `my.auth` file. Example: 
```
kubectl create secret generic azure --from-literal=subscription_id="bd76c882-1234-406c-9574-3ab3c3f41b69" \
--from-literal=tenant_id="3cbc7d20-047b-1234-8b1c-63901c38f690" \
--from-literal=client_id="77b5cf16-64d9-1234-ae1f-2d4ca08b7dea" \
--from-literal=client_secret="19b44614-1234-41a7-b674-bb9df0e25764"
```

Now create Azure Channel
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: messaging.triggermesh.dev/v1alpha1
kind: AzureChannel
metadata:
  name: azure-test
spec:
  event_hub_name: "triggermesh"
  event_hub_region: "WEST US"
  secret_name: "azure"
EOF
```

Note that connecting to Azure and creating your event hub there takes some time (up to 1 minute).

As soon as azure-test channel becomes ready you can subscribe to it with different services also described in `example` folder.
